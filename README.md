Title: Sowing Success: How Machine Learning Helps Farmers Select the Best Crops

Measuring essential soil metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and pH value is crucial for assessing soil condition. However, this process can be expensive and time-consuming, leading farmers to prioritize which metrics to measure based on their budget constraints.

Farmers face the task of deciding which crop to plant each season with the goal of maximizing crop yield. One crucial factor affecting crop growth is the condition of the soil in the field. The condition can be assessed by measuring basic elements such as nitrogen and potassium levels. Each crop has an ideal soil condition ensuring optimal growth and maximum yield.

A farmer has sought your expertise as a machine learning expert to assist in selecting the best crop for the field. They provided you with a dataset named soil_measures.csv, which includes the following columns:
- "N": Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- "P": Phosphorus content ratio in the soil
- "K": Potassium content ratio in the soil
- "pH" value of the soil
- "crop": categorical values containing various crops (target variable)

Each row in this dataset represents various measures of the soil in a particular field. Based on these measurements, the optimal crop for that field is specified in the "crop" column.
